// `describe` is a Mocha function that allows you to organize your tests. It's
// not actually needed, but having your tests organized makes debugging them
// easier. All Mocha functions are available in the global scope.

// `describe` recieves the name of a section of your test suite, and a callback.
// The callback must define the tests of that section. This callback can't be
// an async function.
describe("Token contract", function () {
  // Mocha has four functions that let you hook into the the test runner's
  // lifecyle. These are: `before`, `beforeEach`, `after`, `afterEach`.

  // They're very useful to setup the environment for tests, and to clean it
  // up after they run.

  // A common pattern is to declare some variables, and assign them in the
  // `before` and `beforeEach` callbacks.

  let Token;
  let hardhatToken;
  let owner;

  // `beforeEach` will run before each test, re-deploying the contract every
  // time. It receives a callback, which can be async.

    Token = await ethers.getContractFactory("Token");

    // Note: Ethers.js seems to compute the deployment address of a smart contract via the following formula, instead
    //       of reading it from the ETH RPC response:
    //
    //               contract_addr = sha3(rlp.encode([deployer_address, nonce]))[12:]
    //
    //       Note that Theta's account sequence starts from 1, while Ethereum's account sequence (i.e. nonce) 
    //       starts from 0. Due to this "off-by-one" discrepancy, the token address calculated by ethers.js does not match
    //       with the deployed contract. A **work-around is to deploy each contract twice**. Since the sequence/nonce
    //       increments by 1 each time, the second deployment will deploy the contract to the address calcualted by 
    //       ethers.js. The following pseudo code illustrates the work-around:
    //
    //                token = await Token.Deploy()
    //                tokenAddr = token.address        // tokenAddr is calculated by ethers.js with an "off-by-one" nonce
    //                tokenCopy = await Token.Deploy() // tokenCopy is deployed to tokenAddr

    // To deploy our contract, we just have to call Token.deploy() and await
    // for it to be deployed(), which happens onces its transaction has been
    // mined.
    hardhatToken = await Token.deploy();
    await hardhatToken.deployed();

    // We can interact with the contract by calling `hardhatToken.method()`
    var hardhatTokenCopy = await Token.deploy(); // see the note above, deploy hardhatToken again as a work-around for the address mismatch issue  
    await hardhatTokenCopy.deployed();
